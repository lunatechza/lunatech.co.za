## 2025-05-15 - [Tabnabbing and Iframe Hardening]
**Vulnerability:** Tabnabbing via `target="_blank"` and overly permissive `iframe` permissions.
**Learning:** Even in a static site, external links and embedded content (like Google Maps) can pose security risks if standard defensive attributes are missing.
**Prevention:** Always include `rel="noopener noreferrer"` for external links using `target="_blank"`. Use `sandbox` and `referrerpolicy` for all `iframes` to follow the principle of least privilege.
